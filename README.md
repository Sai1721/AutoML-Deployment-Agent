## 🚀 Project Overview

This project offers a complete AutoML pipeline and deployment framework integrated with Generative AI. It allows users to:

- Upload datasets (CSV format)
- Receive intelligent data cleaning suggestions from Gemini
- Automatically generate Python code to clean the data
- Train ML models using FLAML (AutoML)
- Visualize model explainability with SHAP
- Deploy a web-based predictor UI
- Retrain the model with updated datasets
- Simulate or configure GitHub-based auto-deployment (optional)

## 📦 How It Works (User Flow)

1. **Upload CSV file**
2. **Gemini detects task type & suggests cleaning**
3. **Gemini generates Python cleaning function**
4. **User reviews/executes code**
5. **AutoML training is triggered**
6. **SHAP plots (if compatible) are shown**
7. **Model is saved and can be deployed**
8. **Deployment launches a predictor UI for inputs**
9. **Optional retraining with new dataset**
